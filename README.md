# C++-Projects

This repository represents my continued journey into the realms of code, building upon the knowledge and experience gained from working extensively with C. Here, I delve deeper into more intricate logic, implementations with common **design patterns**, and harness the power of **concurrent programming**.

## Core Features

### Thread Pool and Code Concurrency

One of the key focuses of this repository is exploring **threads** and achieving code concurrency. The **thread pool** program stands out as the most complex piece of software here. It leverages the capabilities of threads to efficiently manage concurrent execution of tasks. By employing a thread pool, the program optimizes resource utilization and enhances performance.

Additionally, the thread pool program integrates the **Watchdog program** from [my C language repository](https://github.com/moshexx/C-linux-DS/tree/main). This ensures robustness and fault tolerance in the execution of tasks, further enhancing the reliability of concurrent code execution.

## Repository Structure

This repository is structured to provide a comprehensive exploration of C++ concepts and applications, particularly in the domain of concurrent programming. The codebase is organized into different directories, each representing a distinct topic or project. You will find clear and well-documented code examples that showcase the usage of threads, synchronization mechanisms, and other relevant C++ features related to **concurrency**.
